# Additional Material for the Course Applied Machine Learning with Python

## Pandas and Matplotlib

 - If you are new to Matplotlib, I strongly encourage to follow the course _Data Visualization with Python_ here at Bocconi. However, I here attach a notebook called `Intro_to_matplotlib.ipynb` to get started with that library.
 - As for Pandas, You can visit the official [documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/index.html#user-guide) to get started with that library. If, instead, you have a basic knowledge of that, and you want to master it, you can check two my articles: one on [stock price analysis](https://andreagiussani.github.io/the-long-beard-blog/beginner/TSAP/) and another one on [video games sales](https://andreagiussani.github.io/the-long-beard-blog/intermediate/DA01/). Enjoy!
